Hack Club UEMK is a university club which represents University of Engineering & Management, Kolkata under the [**Hack Club**](https://hackclub.com/) community. This repository is where we store our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com), as well as our [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct/).

The Hack Club community of UEMK helps you pave a path towards dexterous project conduct, teamwork and skill management. Contribute in projects with the rest of the teammates, and learn the beauty of code.

## Philosophy

We think learning to code is uniquely like gaining a superpower: it converts you from a _consumer_ to a _creator_, turning your computer into a tool for creation. If you’re reading this, you can learn to build anything—there’s never been a better time for making.

We want an inclusive space on the internet where people are making interesting things with code, every week. In our online Slack (Invitation will be sent by filling up the google form on our website) (With more than 10K student members), you can ask coding questions, you’ll meet amazing friends, share projects you’re building, and so much more. Most members start with little to no coding experience, join our Slack, build projects of their own, attend & later organize [hackathons](#).

We’re an entirely open source organization. It’s backed by everyone from [Elon Musk](https://hackclub.com/elon/) to GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner.

## Contributing to our [Workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com/)

Contributions are welcome!

If you need any help, please contact us at hackclubuemk@gmail.com or on our [Slack](https://slack.hackclub.com/).

1. Check out our public issues board. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. First-time contributors should look for the "first-timers-only" label on issues.
3. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You’ll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
5. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
6. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to Hack Club's `main` branch. We'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
